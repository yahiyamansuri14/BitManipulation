1.When you left shift a number like num<<2 it will give you N*(2^i) as result.
2.When you right shift a number like num>>2 it will give you floor value of (N/2^i).
3.Turn off a bit:- 
      3.1perform the operation ~(1<<(k-1)).It will give you a number which has all bits set except the K'th bit.
      3.2perform bitwise AND i.e n&~(1<<(k-1)). You will get the number which has the K'th bit off.
4.Turn on a bit:-
    4.1perform the operation (1<<(k-1)). It will give you a number which has all bits unset except the K'th bit.
    4.2perform bitwise OR i.e n|(1<<(k-1)). You will get the number which has the K'th bit on.
